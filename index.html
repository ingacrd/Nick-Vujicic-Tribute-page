        <p>Nick, by the way, was born without arms or legs.</p>
        <p>The doctors were stunned when his mother gave birth to him. They weren't prepared for Nick's situation and didn't understand what had caused it.</p>
        <p>Nick was very unhappy in his childhood, he felt lonely and angry. It didn't seem fair to him that he had been given a different body from everyone else and he was worried because he felt he could never live the way he wanted. He wondered what he should do with his life.</p>
        <p>One day, he read an article about a disabled man whi inspired thousands of people with his speeches on how to overcome adversity and thought he would like to do the same. His first lecture was given in a room with approximately three hundred fourteen-year-old students.</p>

        <p>Nick was so nervous that he was shaking, but after a few minutes almost all of the students began to cry. A girl raised her hand</p>
        <p>"I'm sorry to interrupr you" she said, but can I come over and give yu a hug?.</p>
        <p>As they hugged, the girl murmured in his ear that no one had told her she was beautiful the way she was, precisely what Nick has just explained to the children in the room.</p>
        <p>From then on, Nick knew what he wanted to do. To date he has traveled to forty-four countries and has given more than three thousand lectures. Wherever he goes, he inspires and moves people. It tells everyone that they are beautiful and that there is someone who loves them, even when it doesn't seem like this.</p>
        <p>"When you think you're not worth enough," Nick says, "you're kidding yourselft. Every time you think you're worthless, you're kidding yourself.</p>
